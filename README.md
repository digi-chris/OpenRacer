# OpenRacer
OpenRacer is an open-source initiative to build a high-quality racing simulation running in-browser.

It is released under the GPLv3 License.

I'm just starting to upload the source code now - this may take a little while as I'm making some modifications as I go through each file.

The files should include everything you need to open this as a project in NetBeans.

Note that I'm being very 'open' with my code - a lot of this is currently a HUGE hack-job, as I never wrote it with the intention of giving out publicly. Therefore, the first major task is going to be reformatting everything for a style guide, taking out any hard-coded elements and restructuring.

With regards to coding conventions - I will be putting together my own set of guidelines as to how this should be coded up, however it'll be based on a standard style guide. My only caveat is that sometimes, in my opinion, OOP and bleeding-edge-get-every-last-drop-out-of-the-CPU efficiency don't go together so well. I fully intend to break OOP conventions in some places, but only when *absolutely* necessary.
